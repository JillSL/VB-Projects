# VB-Projects

Welcome to the **VB-Projects** repository! üëã  
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly VB.NET programs that solve everyday problems and perform fun tasks. Explore, learn, and enjoy coding with these simple yet functional programs written in VB.NET.

## üìÇ Projects Included
1. **Simple Calculator**  
   This program is a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **Temperature Converter**  
   This script allows you to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine easily.

3. **University Projects**  
   This folder contains various projects from my university coursework:

   - **Exercise 1**
   - **Quadratic Equation Discriminant Calculator**
     This Windows Forms application calculates the discriminant (Œî) of a quadratic equation using the formula Œî = b¬≤ - 4ac. It allows users to input the coefficients (A, B, C) of the equation, compute the discriminant, and display the result.
   
   - **Exercise 2**
   - **Simple Computation Form**
     This Windows Forms application allows users to input three values (A, B, C) and compute two outputs (X1, X2) based on those inputs. The program features a menu bar for modifying the background color and includes options to reset the inputs or exit the application.
   
   - **Exercise 3**
   - **Binomial Expansion Calculator**
     This program calculates and displays the binomial expansion based on user input. It allows the user to select the variables (with or without x and y) and enter the coefficients for the expansion. The results are shown in a readable format, and users can reset the inputs or expand the equation further using simple buttons in the interface.
   
   - **Exercise 4**
   - **Numerical Integration Approximator**
     This Windows Forms application creates a form that is designed as an integrator for calculating approximations of the integral ‚à´ ax + b dx, based on user inputs for the coefficients of the equation and the integration bounds. The form allows the user to input the values of the constants (a, b, c), limits of integration, and the number of subdivisions (n) for the approximation. The program calculates the result of the integration using a numerical method, displaying the results and offering options for resetting or exiting the application.
   
   - **Exercise 5**
   - **Matrix Calculator**
     This program allows users to perform basic matrix operations, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, using two input matrices. Users can specify the dimensions of the matrices, input their values, and then click on the corresponding operation buttons to view the result.
   
   - **Exercise 6**
   - **Air Property Calculator**
     The Windows Forms application is designed to calculate and display air properties such as temperature, specific enthalpy, reduced pressure, and specific entropy, likely for thermodynamic or engineering purposes. The program also integrates with a database, allowing users to retrieve, add, and save data related to air properties using a BindingNavigator.
   
   - **Final Project**
   - **Centroid Calculator**
     This program is a Windows Forms application designed to allow users to draw shapes and calculate their centroids. It provides an intuitive interface for adding and finalizing shapes, with functionality to handle user input and perform centroid calculations. The program aims to streamline the process of determining the center of mass for various geometric shapes.
   
   - **Hello World**  
     A basic program that displays "Hello, World!" on the screen, used to familiarize with VB.NET syntax.

   - **Palindrome Checker**  
     This tool checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward.

## üíª Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:  
   `git clone https://github.com/JillSL/vb-projects.git`

2. **Navigate to the folder**  
   Use the following command to move into the project folder:  
   `cd vb-projects`

3. **Run the desired script**  
   To run a specific script, open it in your VB.NET IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) and execute the program.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To use these programs, you need a VB.NET-compatible IDE (such as Visual Studio) installed on your system.  
Additionally, you can use any standard text editor to view or modify the scripts.
